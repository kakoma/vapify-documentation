## Overview

Managing your agency settings is crucial for personalizing the Vapify platform to reflect your brand. Follow these steps to configure your agency settings effectively.

### Configure Agency Name, Logo, and Favicon

Begin by navigating to **Agency > General**. Update the **Agency Name** field with your agency’s name. Then, upload your agency logo and favicon to ensure the platform aligns with your branding. Click "Save Agency Settings," and log out and back in to see the changes.

### Configure Subdomain (Starter, Business, or Pro Plan)

For those on the Starter, Business, or Pro Plan, you can set up a custom subdomain. Follow the instructions to create a **CNAME record** for your subdomain. After setting up and waiting for propagation (up to 48 hours), click "Verify Domain" to confirm the setup. You’ll receive an email notification once your subdomain is ready. In the meantime, you can access the platform at **app.vapify.agency**.

### Configure Email Address

To ensure emails from the platform come from your agency's email, select either **Postmark** or **Mailgun** and enter the API key. If using SMTP, provide the necessary details (username, password, SMTP server hostname, and port). If you're using **Google Workspace**, generate an **app password** instead of using your Google password, and enable "Less Secure Apps" in your settings.

Your agency management setup is now complete!
