## Assistant Management Overview

From the Assistant Management page at **Platform > Assistants**, you can enable or disable your voice assistants. 

## Assistant Activation

Once you've retrieved all your Vapi.ai assistants, it's time to activate them. Navigate to **Platform > Assistants** to activate each assistant you want to have live for the subaccount. Activating your assistants helps you stay within the limits set by your current plan.

> **Note:** Once a subaccount goes live (discussed further in **Step Five**), you cannot change which assistants are active. Make sure to activate every assistant you want to be live before going live.

## Assistant Pricing Setup

### Assistant Per Minute Pricing Setup

With your assistants activated, head over to **Agency > Sub Accounts** and select each assistant. For every assistant, set the **price per minute** that you plan to charge your client. It’s important to ensure that this price is higher than what **Vapi.ai** charges you for that assistant. 

> If you change an assistant’s price per minute in Vapi, remember to update it here as well. This helps avoid charging your client less than what Vapi charges you otherwise you'll lose money.

By effectively managing your assistants, you can ensure smooth operations and maximize revenue for your agency.
