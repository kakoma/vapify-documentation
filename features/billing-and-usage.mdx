## Overview

Monitoring your billing and usage is essential for managing finances and ensuring accurate client invoicing. Hereâ€™s how to navigate this section effectively.

### Review Reports

After going live with your subaccount, call records will be retrieved from Vapi, and the pricing you set will be applied. Call records are retrieved at the top of every hour.

To view call records and pricing applications, go to **Billing & Usage**.

- **Billing Summary**: Here, you can view all payments made, including subscriptions and credit top-ups.

- **Voice Usage Revenue**: This section shows the pricing applied per call, including:
  - Call duration
  - Your charge per minute
  - Total charge
  - **Vapi.ai Total Cost**
  - **Vapify Total Cost**
  - Your **profit**

For **subaccount users**, the **Voice Usage Revenue** tab shows a simplified version, hiding:
  - **Vapi.ai Total Cost**
  - **Vapify Total Cost**
  - **Profit**

This ensures subaccounts focus only on their usage, without backend cost details.
