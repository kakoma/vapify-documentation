## Quickstart Guide

To help you get up and running with Vapify, follow these five essential steps:

### Step 1: Agency Settings Configuration
Start by configuring your agency settings:
- **Navigate to the Agency Settings** in your dashboard. Here, you can upload your agency logo and set up custom branding to reflect your business identity.
- **Configure core settings**, including payment methods, notification preferences, and any specific settings that align with your agency’s operations. This ensures that you’re set up for seamless client interactions.

### Step 2: Sub Accounts Configuration
Once your agency settings are in place:
- **Go to the Sub Accounts section** to create individual accounts for your clients. This allows them to access and manage their own voice assistants within your platform.
- **Set specific permissions** for each subaccount, tailoring access and features based on your clients’ needs. This customization enhances their experience and ensures they have the necessary tools at their disposal.

### Step 3: Assistant Activation
Now it's time to activate your voice assistants:
- **In the Manage Assistants area**, you can create and configure the voice assistants you’ll be deploying. Each assistant can be customized with specific responses and functionalities.
- **Set the activation status** to "active" for each assistant that is ready to be used. This ensures that they are live and operational, ready to assist your clients.

### Step 4: Assistant Pricing Setup
After configuring your assistants:
- **Access the Pricing section** to set up how you will charge for voice assistant services. You can implement per-minute charges and other pricing models that suit your business strategy.
- **Ensure your pricing aligns** with your agency’s business model and client expectations. Clear pricing structures will help you maintain transparency and trust with your clients.

### Step 5: Going Live
Finally, prepare to launch your services:
- **Review all configurations** to ensure everything is set up correctly and functions as intended. This includes double-checking agency settings, subaccounts, and assistant configurations.
- **Launch your voice assistants** and start engaging with clients. This is where you can demonstrate the value of your services and begin building long-lasting relationships.

## Review Billing and Usage Reports
After going live, it’s essential to monitor performance:
- **Regularly check the Billing and Usage reports** to track activity, revenue, and resource consumption. This will help you identify trends and areas for improvement.
- If everything is functioning well, head back to the **Sub Accounts section** to invite your clients to join and utilize their newly activated voice assistants.
